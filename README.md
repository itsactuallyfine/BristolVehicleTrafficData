# BristolVehicleTraffic

A weekend data science investigation into Bristol's open vehicle traffic data set.
(avaible from: https://opendata.bristol.gov.uk/explore/dataset/historic-journey-times/ )

Data is cleaned (lots of N/A's, repeats, change to UNIX timestamp etc...)
Then processed to find typical days, on typical sections of the road network
we all looked at collision data

We also published a summary of our results on a rudimentary website we made: http://seis.bris.ac.uk/~ae13414/
